## 268. Missing Number

Given an array containing *n* distinct numbers taken from `0, 1, 2, ..., n`, find the one that is missing from the array.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [3,0,1]
<b>Output:</b> 2
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
<b>Output:</b> 8
</pre>

**Note:**<br/>
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?
