## 38. Count and Say

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

<pre>
<b>1.</b>     1
<b>2.</b>     11
<b>3.</b>     21
<b>4.</b>     1211
<b>5.</b>     111221
</pre>

- `1` is read off as `"one 1"` or `11`.
- `11` is read off as `"two 1s"` or `21`.
- `21` is read off as `"one 2, then one 1"` or `1211`.

Given an integer n where 1 ≤ *n* ≤ 30, generate the *n*<sup>th</sup> term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

**Example 1:**

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> 1
<b>Output:</b> "1"
</pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> 4
<b>Output:</b> "1211"
</pre>
